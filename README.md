# GitRoot Test
Demo repository for our VCS implementation in python for Software Tools and Technologies Lab 2 Course

- The file 'file' was commited to github using the tool built by us - ([Ashutosh Sahu](https://github.com/ashutoshfreak), [Shreya gundu](https://github.com/Shreyagundu) and Me) in STNT2 Course during the demo.
- [VCS Project at Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/KShivendu/vcs/src/master/)
- Basically it just does exactly what git does, but using python. So it can be smoothly used together with git also.
